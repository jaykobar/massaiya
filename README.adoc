# Massa: The Decentralized and Scaled Blockchain

Massa is a truly decentralized blockchain controlled by thousands of people. 
With the breakthrough multithreaded technology, weâ€™re set for mass adoption.


## Introduction

link:https://massa.net[Massa] is a new blockchain reaching a high transaction throughput in a decentralized network. 
Our research is published in this link:https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09029[technical paper].
It shows that a throughput of 10'000 transactions per second is reached even in a fully decentralized network with thousands of nodes.

An easy-to-read blog post introduction with videos is written link:https://massa.net/blog/post/0/)[here].

We are now releasing the **Massa testnet** in this Gitlab repository, with its explorer available at link:https://test.massa.net[test.massa.net].


## Testnet Incentives

As decentralization is our core value, we would like to help you start and run a Massa node. 
Running a node during the testnet phase also helps us finding bugs and improving usability, so it will be rewarded with real Massa on mainnet launch. 

The mechanics and amounts of those rewards are currently in discussion, the main idea is that the more block rewards you receive, the more Massa you will get at launch, with a per-person cap.
 

## Testnet Discussions

## Install on Ubuntu / MacOS

On Windows, please go to the link:docs/windows_install.adoc[Install and Run on Windows] page.

* On Ubuntu, these libs must be installed: `sudo apt install pkg-config curl git build-essential libssl-dev`
* install link:https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install[rustup] : `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
* configure path: `source $HOME/.cargo/env`
* check rust version: `rustc --version`
* install link:https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/rustup-for-managing-rust-versions.html[nigthly]: `rustup toolchain install nightly`
* set it as default: `rustup default nightly`
* check rust version: `rustc --version`
* clone this repo: `git clone https://gitlab.com/massalabs/massa.git`

## Run

### Start the node

On a first window:
----
cd massa/massa-node/
----

Launch the node, on Ubuntu:
----
RUST_BACKTRACE=full cargo run --release |& tee logs.txt
----

On MacOS: 
----
RUST_BACKTRACE=full cargo run --release > logs.txt 2>&1
----

### Start the client

On a second window:
----
cd massa/massa-client/
cargo run --release
----


## Update
----
cd massa/
git pull
----

## Troubleshooting

* If your API can't start, e.g. with `could not start API controller: ServerError(hyper::Error(Listen, Os { code: 98, kind: AddrInUse, message: "Address already in use" }))`, it's probably because the default API port 3030 is already in use on your computer. You should change the port in the config files, both in the API and Client:
 ** in file `massa/massa-node/config/config.toml`, in section [API], in bind, put a new port,
 ** in file `massa/massa-client/config/config.toml`, put that same port.
